	   <h1 class="text-color-black">About Sachin</h1>
	   <p><b>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar</b> (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ (About this soundlisten); born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[5]
	   He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket.
Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years.
 He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the
 holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.[6] He is colloquially known as Little Master or Master
 Blaster,[7][8][9][10] In 2001, Sachin Tendulkar became the first batsman to complete 10,000 ODI runs in his 259 innings.[11] In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind
 Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[12] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a 
part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World</p>
